      title: "How to Pray in Islam",
      text: `Prayer (salat; plural salah or "salawat") is one of the five pillars of Islam. Completing the five daily prayers in the way taught by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is an obligation for all adult Muslims (those who have reached puberty), and should be strictly required of children aged ten and over. It is believed that communication with Allah is critical to strengthening the faith of the believer. Muslims believe that Allah speaks to us through the Qur'an, and salah is our means of responding to Allah. Whether you're just curious as to how Muslims pray or if you're looking to learn for yourself, it's never too early to start.`,

      title: "1. Ensure the area chosen for prayer is clean and free of impurities.",
      text: `This includes your body, your clothes, and the place of prayer itself. Perform wudu. You must be ritually pure before you go start praying. If you're not, it's required to perform wudu (ablution) before you do. If since your last prayer, you have urinated, defecated, passed gas, bled excessively, passed madhy (seminal fluid), or fallen asleep leaning/laying down, you need to perform wudu.[1] If you are praying in a masjid (mosque), which is highly encouraged for men, enter quietly—other Muslims might still be praying and you don't want to disturb them. Many Muslims families keep a dedicated area for salah in their home. If you are unsure of the cleanliness of your area, spread a mat on the floor for good measure. This prayer rug is very important to Islamic culture.`,

    },
    {
      title: "2. Perform ghusl (full shower) if needed",
      text: `Certain circumstances will require that you perform ghusl instead of wudu to be fully cleansed by removing najas (impurities) before praying. You need to perform ghusl if you wish to pray after having sexual intercourse, ending your menstruation period or postpartum bleeding, giving birth, having a wet dream or ejaculating with sexual pleasure. [2] To perform ghusl, you must wash your entire body and hair with water. It is recommended that you wash 3 times, making sure every part of the skin has been run under water. Note that when you perform either wudu or ghusl, anything that prevents water from touching the obligatory areas of the body must be removed, including things such as nail polish, accessories, and waterproof mascara.[3] If you do not perform wudu or ghusl when required by the Shariah then the prayer will not be valid and will not be accepted.`,

    {
      title: "3. Perform tayammum (dry purification) if needed",
      text: `If a Muslim is unable to use water, he or she may choose to perform tayammum instead of wudu or ghusl. This rite involves using clean soil or dirt or a natural rock that has not been used before to perform tayammum.`,

      title: "4. Face the Qibla",
      text: `This is the direction all Muslims face to turn in prayer towards the Holy Ka'bah. The Holy Mosque in Mecca is the most revered place of worship for Muslims around the entire world. All Muslims are required to face the Ka'bah five times every day when offering their prayers.
               If you are traveling on a ship or airplane and fear that the time of prayer will end before you reach someplace where you can determine the direction of Ka'bah then, in that case, you can offer Salat without facing Ka'bah. It is Mustahab (recommended) that one face the Ka'bah at least during the takbeer of ihram (saying "Allahu Akbar" at the beginning of Salat).`,
      image: "./src/assets/PrayinIslam/image4.jpeg",
    },
    {
      title: "5. Pray at the proper time",
      text: `The five prayers of each day take place at very specific times according to one's geographic location and the time of year.[11] For each one, there is a brief period of time it can be performed, determined by the rising and falling of the sun. Each fard salah takes about 5 to 10 minutes from start to finish, but should never be hurried.
Try to pray the prayers at the start of the appointed time, as Allah will appreciate your enthusiasm to pray.
The five prayers are Fajr, Zuhr, Asr, Maghrib, and Isha. They are at dawn, afternoon, in the mid-afternoon, at sunset, and at night, respectively. They are not at the same time each day, as they are timed by the sun, which changes path throughout the seasons.
Each of the five salah contains a specified number of rak'ah (units), as follows: Obligatory prayers: - Fajr prayer (2 units (Rak'ah)) - Dhuhr prayer (4 units (Rak'ah)) - Asr prayer (4 units (Rak'ah)) - Maghrib prayer (3 units (Rak'ah)) - Isha prayer (4 units (Rak'ah))
Additionally, many Muslims chose to follow the example of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) by praying additional optional prayers around the obligatory prayers, giving a daily cycle as follows:
Fajr - Two rak'ah sunnah mu'akkadah (optional but highly recommended), then two rak'ah fardh (obligatory);
Zuhr - Four rak'ah sunnah mu'akkadah (optional but highly recommended), then four rak'ah fardh (obligatory), then two rak'ah sunnah mu'akkdah (optional but highly recommended), then two rak'ah nafl (optional);
Asr - Four rak'ah sunnah ghayr mu'akkadah (optional but spiritually beneficial), then four rak'ah fardh (obligatory);
Maghrib - Three rak'ah fardh (obligatory), then two rak'ah sunnah mu'akkadah (optional but highly recommended), then two rak'ah nafl (optional);
Isha - Four rak'ah sunnah, then four rak'ah fardh (obligatory), then two rak'ah sunnah mu'akkadah (optional but highly recommended), then two rak'ah nafl (optional), then three rak'ah witr (optional but highly recommended), then two rak'ah nafl (optional).
Whilst there is no penalty for not performing the sunnah and nafl prayers, they are a gift from Allah that should be embraced to improve one's connection with Allah and earn extra rewards.`,

      title: "6. Learn to say prayers in Arabic",
      text: `Salah must be performed in the Arabic language because this is the language that the Qur’an was revealed in. It also allows Muslims outside of Arabic-speaking countries to recite the prayers and understand what is being said. Speaking all prayers in the same language avoids the confusion of translating words into other languages.[7]
Use online sources to help you pronounce the obligatory prayer words, such as Rosetta Stone[8] , Salaam Arabic[9] , hosted by Pangaea Learning, Madinah Arabic[10] or Youtube[11] sources.
Take a course in Arabic at your local college. Learn and practice the correct pronunciations with an Arabic speaker as the prayer may be invalid if it is not recited correctly.
Non-Arabic speaking children will benefit from attending evening or weekend madrassa classes to learn Arabic and study the Qur'an.`,

    {
      title: "7. Cover yourself.",
      text: `Men and women must both cover themselves with material that covers the skin throughout the prayer. While women must cover everything but their faces and hands, men must keep the area between their navel and knees covered.[12] The material must cover the body during prayer movements. So if, for example, bending causes a piece of material to slip and expose skin on a woman’s neck, she would need to ensure that her clothing is tucked in properly or put more clothing on before she can start her prayer.`,

    },
    {
      title: "8. Make your intention known in your heart",
      text: `Before initiating the salat, it is important that you have the intention to pray. This can be in your own language. For example, you may say (in your heart, not out loud) "I intend to perform two rakats Fajr salah, seeking nearness to Allah, in obedience to Him".`,

      title: "9. Raise your hands up next to your ears and shoulders, then say Allāhu akbar (الله أَكْبَر)",
      text: `This translates to "Allah is the greatest." Do this while standing (or sitting if you can't stand). The fingers should be spaced when the hands are raised.`,

    {
      title: "10. Place your right hand over your left hand.",
      text: `Place your hands either on your navel, on your chest, or between the two; there's a difference of opinion between Islamic schools of thoughts. Keep your eyes focused on the ground. It helps to keep your sight fixed on where your head will rest when prostrating later. Do not let your eyes wander.
Recite the optional Istiftah Du'a (opening prayer):

Subhanakal-lahumma
Wabihamdika watabarakas-muka wataaaala
Jadduka wala ilaha ghayruk.
A’auodu billaahi minash-shaytaanir rajeem
Bis-millaahir rahmaanir raheem
Follow it with Surah Al-Fatiha (this Surah is recited in each Rak'ah):

Bismillaahir Rahmaanir Raheem
Alhamdu lillaahi Rabbil 'aalameen
Ar-Rahmaanir-Raheem
Maaliki Yawmid-Deen
Iyyaaka na'budu wa lyyaaka nasta'een
Ihdinas-Siraatal-Mustaqeem
Siraatal-ladheena an'amta 'alaihim
Ghayril-maghdoobi 'alaihim wa lad-daaalleen
Recite any other surah or any part of the Qu'ran, such as Surah Ikhlas:

Qul huwal laahu ahad
Allah hus-samad
Lam yalid wa lam yoolad
Wa lam yakul-lahu kufuwan ahad
Reciting a surah after Al-Fatiha is only done in the first 2 units (Rakaa's) of fardh salat while in sunnah mu'akkadah it is done in all units (Rakaa's)`,

Your back and head should be at a 90° angle with your legs. You don't need to make a perfect angle; your body should be relaxed. This position is called ruku.
While bowing, say, Subhanna Rabbiyal Adheem three times. This translates to, "Glorious is my Lord the most great."`,
